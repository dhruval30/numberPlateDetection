# Number Plate Detection

This project focuses on detecting number plates in images using YOLOv5. Currently, it only handles the **detection part**â€”the character recognition for extracting plate numbers will be added later when I have more time to work on it.

## What's Included
- Prepares a dataset with images and corresponding XML annotations.
- Helper functions for processing filenames and bounding box data.
- Sets up the data to be used for YOLOv8 model training.

## What's Missing
- Character recognition to read the numbers/letters from detected plates.

This is a work-in-progress, so it's not complete yet, but the detection part is functional-ish.
